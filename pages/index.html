        <p>I'm a person who loves to be in the mountains and in nature, and I like to spend time on feet, usually in running shoes or on skis.
        At day time I work in research, with a focus on applied machine learning in fields ranging from health and sports to manufacturing.
        On this webpage I post photos, blog posts, projects and other stuff (sometimes in English, other times in Norwegian).</p>

        <p>I work in research, focusing on applied machine learning. I have a MSc degree in Computational Science from the University of Oslo, Norway. 
        I love to be in the mountains, and spend most of my spare time running and skiing off the beaten track. I also play piano and church organ.</p>
