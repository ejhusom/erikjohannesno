I usually discover new books to read through references or quotes from previous books I have read, but sometimes I also get some useful recommendations from blogs or people I talk to. 
I usually finish all the books I start reading, even if I dislike them when I'm halfway through (which probably is a bad habit),

Summarizing some of the best books I read in 2022:

### *Scrambles Amongst the Alps* by Edward Whymper


### *The Mountains of my Life* by Walter Bonatti

### *The Way Home* by Mark Boyle

### *The Shallows* by Nicolas Carr


### *Stand out of our Light* by James Williams 


### *The Age of Low Technolgoies* by Philippe Bihouix


### *Amusing Ourselves to Death* by Neil Postman
