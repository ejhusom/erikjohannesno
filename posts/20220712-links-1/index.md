Some links I find worth sharing:

- [On digital footprints](https://weeklymusings.net/weekly-musings-125?pk_campaign=rss-feed) from Weekly Musings.
- [Better search results](https://tdarb.org/better-search-results/index.html) by Brad Taunt.
- [You're attention didn't collapse. It was stolen](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/attention-span-focus-screens-apps-smartphones-social-media) from The Guardian.
