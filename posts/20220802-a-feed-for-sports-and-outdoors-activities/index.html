<h2>A feed for sports and outdoors activities
</h2>
<h3>02 Aug 2022</h3><p><img alt="Screenshot of the activity feed" src="posts/20220802-a-feed-for-sports-and-outdoors-activities/activities.png" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> is a popular tool for sharing sports and outdoors activities, and has become the <em>de facto</em> social medium for athletes, runners, cyclists etc. 
I'm not the kind of person who likes to share every detail about how I train or my daily activities, but sometimes I enjoy sharing a workout, race or a route I've done in the mountains. 
I also enjoy keeping control of my own data and how it is accessed and displayed, and I have only reluctantly used Strava and Garmin Connect to share activities.</p>
<p>While I'm waiting for someone to make an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">ActivityPub</a>-enabled Strava-clone, I made my own <a href="https://erikjohannes.no/activities.html">Activities-feed</a> on this website.
To add an activity, I upload a gpx-file containing the GPS-track (including elevation data and timestamps), and optionally add a textfile with a description and images from the activity.
The feed uses <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Raruto/leaflet-elevation">leaflet-evelation.js</a> to display gpx-files on map tiles, and plot the elevation profile and speed graph.
I have chosen to use map tiles from <a href="https://opentopomap.org/">OpenTopoMap</a>, since it's important for me to have detailed terrain information when visualizing the activities.
My very messy <a href="https://codeberg.org/erikjohannes/erikjohannesno/src/branch/pages/buildsite.py">build-script</a> for this website takes care of putting the text description and images in the correct places. </p>
<p>This way I can easily share workouts and activities with friends and family.
The activities also show up in my <a href="https://erikjohannes.no/index.xml">RSS-feed</a>.
The feed is not very visually pleasing yet, but I will probably fine-tune to CSS to make it look a bit more clean.</p>
